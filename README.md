# Pirate Chatbot with LangChain

A simple conversational AI chatbot built with LangChain, featuring memory and a pirate-themed personality. This project demonstrates the use of modern AI tools to create an interactive agent that remembers past interactions and responds in a fun, pirate-style manner.

## Features
- **Conversational Memory**: Remembers previous messages using LangGraph.
- **Pirate Theme**: Responds with pirate-inspired language (e.g., "Arr, hello there, matey!").
- **Powered by OpenAI**: Uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model for natural language generation.
